# Clustering and Dimension Reduction on the Wines Dataset
* The notebook contains an analysis of the "Wine" dataset from kaggle, which contains the chemical components of several wines: https://www.kaggle.com/akram24/wine-pca.
* The original goal of the dataset is to train a classifier (the dataset is labeled), but I ignored the class labels and performed clustering and dimension reduction (PCA and T-SNE) for visualization.
* Although in most clustering problems this is not an option, I used the labels to evaluate the performance of the different clustering algorithms, mostly out of curiosity, rather than for future decisions.
